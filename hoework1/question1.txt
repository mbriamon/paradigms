Q1.1 Scope of Variables

		a: the entire program
		b: within the function myFunction()
		c: the first reference of c is only visible within the if statement, the initiation of variable c is visible within the entire program (starting at line 12)
		d: online visible within the if statement

Q1.2 Explain the Output

		Every time JS has console.log() the variable referenced is printed.
			- 6: the sum of a=1, b=2, c=3. All of these variables are visible within the scope of the if statement
			- 3: the sum of a=1, b=2. Both these variables are visible within th function 		
			- 1: printing the variable a, which has not been changed since it was originally set to 1
			- 20: variable c was initiated to 20 on line 12,prints this value
			- ERROR: there is an error because d is onlly visible within the if statement, cannot be referenced outside of it
